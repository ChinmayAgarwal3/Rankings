# STARTUP PROJECT IDEAS

#### Small Ones

- Private curated news feed across paywalls
    - Uses a browser with paywall extention –> scrapes from the websites  –> shows in an acceptable format
- Online notepad with connected app
    - Allowing to input thoughts from the mobile into the private database
- Create the job allocation funnel from the TEDx video
- Portfolio(CV, resume,achievements list, certificates)
    - Prepared to send/show the resume/CV/ achievements etc
- Laptop store and guide
    - Takes input for the requirements of the user –> runs against the database for the best results –> checks if these ones are available in amazon+flipkart –> shows these laptops as either available on store/online giving links for online and the store
- Private social network,
    - better feed, can create personal feeds using web scraping
    - open expressions and feelings, closed group, real views on topics and debates, share ideas and deep things with close friends; no repurcusions,
    -  invoke discussion, debates, ideas, platform for mastermind groups, strengthen friendship

#### Big Ones

- Mapping web app to map the top problems in industries after the results of exploration such that we have a base class industry around which sub classes as various industries, these will have properties as to various problems it faces. the problems will have various potential solutions/ideas and stats to compare them/ 

    Requirements:

    - Each of the solution is to be a unique compilation document which can store all types of data, new types and fields can be created to compare with other solutions: stats important and relative to the industry and problem. Like an object whose properties can be redefined in the class as the problems and solution nodes go

    - The inheritance and polymorphic OOP language like Python or java or maybe sometime later javascript for the subclasses and nodes and stuff. This thing will look like a vast tree with the ability to add/ remove nodes. Each tree will be an industry and each node a problem or a solution type. Problem comes from the root, solution from the problem.

        

- Value Chain Mapping Software

    Wardley maps mapping the whole sectors and industries such that variations in prices and offers can be effectively mapped and their effects and applications can be analysed and strategised as business opportunities.

- ​	Decision making tool

    (Variables in the format would include: 

    - Emperical data and it's suggestions, expectations, volatility etc
    - Dependency on historical data, how new is the situation
    - Benefit of the decision, for whose benefit is it being made, best for you/ company/ board and does it align with what they want in the long run
    - Pros cons, After effects and possible chain of outcomes and their likelihood of each scenario
    - Opportunity costs
    - Supplementary information required
    - What are the alternatives
    - Supplementary decisions and actions which will be needed if the decision is made
    - Potential biases and their effects
    - Who will be the stake holders and what is their immediate job after the decision,
    - $no ambiguity over whose decision it is to make
    - Whose advice can be taken and how biased can it be and why - sought all sides
    - Who will be the devil's advocate)
