#Issues Ranking



1. Choice of doctor, whom to show, not all are suitable. Lack of Trust. Which works?

    1. Mostly for small reasons they are fine, anyone works and this can be replaced soon-later by AI which can perform better and cheaper and faster

    2. For critical cases the problem arises, various diagnoses, multiple drugs in the system, how and what will work out, very serious issue

    3. Also in India there are many doctors who work for money and the system can drain money from the people unnecessarily also creating health risks while at it 

        

2. Labour in agriculture

    1. Most labour know they can never get rich and comfortable so they give up and live drunk; donot work unless necessary for food and survival on a day to day basis. 

    2. This market needs to be replaced by machines which are most trustable and better performers as well. This will also give time for farmers to pursue other stuff online, however this will create huge inequality between people who own and donot own land. Govt should take in land,  distribute profits between a defined group

        

3. Broken Education System

    1. Lack of mentorship and guidance
    
    2. Lack of smart people and exposure to them; low level of competition for ideas and innovation and development
    
        
    
4. Fake News

    1. Twitter is handling the issue, Facebook will only be reserved for idiots and will soon go down

    2. Large corporations will remain trustable sources till they fall down and someone comes up at the right moment. 

    3. There are news checker websites and debunker websites, dedicated to resolving fake news

        

5. Unemployment + Poverty : Rather acceptable distribution of wealth

    1. Sooner or later machines will take over

    2. Univerasal Basic Income will kick in, if it works-> well enough otherwise â€“>revolution

    3. Meaningless of life; and purpose and drive without work?

        

6. Failed democracies and Goverments + War and corruption

    1. Till the time it kills them slowly and to a point, it will remain acceptable
    2. Humans systems will never work freely and bias free, but robotic systems can. Let the robots take over as Judges, Governments and decision makers and systems can truly be incorruptible. War would come at a standby and there would be peace all over. everyone living their peaceful lives under the protection and trust of the AI
