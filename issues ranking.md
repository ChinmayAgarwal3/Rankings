#Issues Ranking



1. Choice of doctor, whom to show, not all are suitable. Lack of Trust. Which works?

    1. Mostly for small reasons they are fine, anyone works and this can be replaced soon-later by AI which can perform better and cheaper and faster

    2. For critical cases the problem arises, various diagnoses, multiple drugs in the system, how and what will work out, very serious issue

    3. Also in India there are many doctors who work for money and the system can drain money from the people unnecessarily also creating health risks while at it 

        

2. Labour in agriculture

    1. Most labour know they can never get rich and comfortable so they give up and live drunk; donot work unless necessary for food and survival on a day to day basis. 

    2. This market needs to be replaced by machines which are most trustable and better performers as well. This will also give time for farmers to pursue other stuff online, however this will create huge inequality between people who own and donot own land. Govt should take in land,  distribute profits between a defined group

        

3. Broken Education System

    1. Lack of mentorship and guidance
    2. Lack of smart people and exposure to them; low level of competition for ideas and innovation and development
